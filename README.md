Background: 
A leading environmental solutions company, is developing a waste sorting mobile application aimed at promoting sustainable waste management practices. The application will serve as an educational tool for individuals and communities, providing guidance on 
proper waste disposal techniques and encouraging recycling habits. As a recent graduate developer at the company, I've been tasked with implementing REST endpoints to enable communication between the frontend and backend systems of the application.

Scenario: 
I am a part of a dedicated team working on the development of the waste sorting mobile application at the company. My team is passionate about environmental sustainability and is committed to creating a user-friendly and informative application that 
empowers users to make environmentaly conscious decisions. The application will feature various functionalities, including waste category lookup, disposal guidelines retrieval, and recycling tips display. Your role is to design and implement REST endpoints 
using Spring Boot that facilitate data exchange between the frontend mobile application and the backend server.

Build a Spring Boot application that exposes a REST API for clients:
* Design RESTful APIs using Spring Boot to expose the required functionalities for data retrieval and manipulation.
* Define resource URIs, request methods, request/response payloads, and error handling mechanisms for each endpoint.
* Implement endpoints to save/update/delete/retrieve data such as waste categories, disposal guidelines, and recycling tips.
* Ensure that the endpoints return JSON-formatted responses containing relevant data in a structured format.
* Implement input validation using Spring Boot validation annotations to ensure the integrity and validity of incoming requests and data payloads.

This was an assessment that I got from one of the graduate programs that I applied for. Its important to note that this was not what I submitted to the graduate program at the end of the deadline that was set by the people. I was barely familiar with the IDE
and Springboot, but I viewed this task as a learning opportunity as well as a challenge. Which is why I'm uploading this here, to show how refining and learning frameworks can result in exercising and taking power of coding environments in a way that is scalable (if
I were to give this API to other developers and if it were to be developed further).

So here I present my first RESTful-API in Springboot coded in Java! I'm very proud of the project and I tried to take time to apply it to an industry level so I tried to create folders and create the illusion of the different layers of an API and comments to 
give way to other developers if I was working in a team. Some people may be discouraged from getting rejected based off a coding assessment but I implore people to listen to the feedback (if they can get any) for the assessment and implement it as well improving on what
you already have so you're better equipped, as a Software Developer.
