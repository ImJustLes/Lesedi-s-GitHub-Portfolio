# REFLECTION FOR THE APPLICAITON

For context, in Varsity College we get POEs (Portfolio of Evidence). POEs are basically several assignemtns that are interconnected to one another under the name of a POE. For programming, in my second semester of my second year, we had a 3 part POE that composed of developing a WPF application that would store student information like their name, what modules/subjects they are doing and when their semester starts and ends. We had to make a library of methods and properties in a different solution and had to reference it to our project. I wish I could give more clarity in terms of what the goal was, but I, unfortunately, am incapable of accessing the POE because it is PDF protected for some reason.

The reason why I put this project is because I am proud of what I learnt and I'm especially proud of how I conducted myself throughout this segment of the POE. For part 1, I made the original WPF application with the requirements that I listed above, but, for part 2 I had to make the data persist for different runtimes. This was my first time using databases directly with an application in the backend and I learnt a lot of valuable things like SQL injects, the flow of a WPF application and how having a library for all your different methods and properties is important for your code being comprehendable and scalable. I started the project well before the due date and conducted myself smartly. I would do a bit of the project everyday throughout the time I gave myself to complete it.

I got 100% for this part which made me very happy.

Looking back at it now, I can definitely say I can improve on a lot.
I could have made methods that would retreieve information instead of having that repeated throughout.
I could have made an effort to lessen the retrieval of data from the SQL database so that it would be more optimized for real-life use.
I could have improved the code for me checking for duplicate users and duplicate modules/subjects.
My front-end is not AMAZING by any means, so it can be improved.

Overall, I ran into issues, just like any other projects, but I managed to overcome the challanges of it every time in this project.
