# LESEDI'S GITHUB PORTFOLIO
Welcome to my repositiory! The projects that I've accomplished are in different bracnhes. Each branch of the repo represents its own seperate project.

I am Lesedi Maela a, 22 year old, graduate from Varsity College with a Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences in Application Development. Ever since I started the degree, I have naturally gravitated towards the programming aspect of my degree, throughout my years thus far. This is evident with my programming modules being my best modules for every semester, in terms of performance. The languages that I'm proficient in are Java, C# and SQL. I am currently learning Kotlin in my final year. My strongest language is, by far, C#. Its a language that feels more natural to me when I code and that may be partly because the majority of my degree was and is composed of C# for assigments for my programming modules.

Backend development with languages such as C#, has always been my strength. Whenever I would run into a problem, I would attempt to troubleshoot it by doing research or asking the people around me like tutors or fellow people of my degree and I believe that is useful in the workplace in IT. Being able to act independtly but knowing your limit so that you can still accomplish the project objective/task that is given.

I have skills in/with:

* ASP.NET MVC Application
* .NET Framework Applications (Windows Presentation Foundation(WPF) and Windows Form)
* SQL Sever Management
* Microsoft Azure
* Oracle Database
* MongoDB
* Android Studio (Kotlin and XML)
* Firebase
* Google Maps
* Object-Orientated Programming
* Design Patterns
* Advanced Data Structures
* Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition
* Visual Studio Code

So far, I have only done school related projects but I do plan on adding and/or doing projects outside of college for myself.
