This project is, definitely, the biggest project that I worked on. The team for the website was myself, Lwando and Olifiloe.
We worked days and nights to get this functioning and deployed. 
I mainly worked on the admin and student portal. I also was in charge with putting all the different portals into one for the website.
It was hosted on Azure for a short time, Firebase was used to store data and authenticate users, and Google Maps API to get user locations.
I learnt a lot from the project and can confidentally say that I will be better prepared for the next huge project (Whether its personal or on the clock)
